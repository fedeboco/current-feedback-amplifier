# Current Feedback Topology 40W Audio Amplifier

The current feedback topology gives this amplifier some independency between gain and bandwidth, resulting in an amplifier with relatively high power and high bandwidth (around 450 kHz at full power). Having a higher bandwidth than the traditional audio band (up to 20 kHz) produces a lower phase distortion in the audio band, consequently producing better sound.

## Total Harmonic Distortion Measured

Distortion did not exceed 0,2% at full power, rating at around 0,1% on average of frequencies.

## Previous Version

This version was bigger than the current version. It was also difficult to measure, more unstable and produced higher temperatures.
